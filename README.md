# Hipponaut

## Concept
A video-game that spawned from Global Game Jam 2017, Hipponaut is a cute space shooter, where Hipponaut - a Hippo astronaut - is on a quest to save the galaxy from the evil Salty Richard - a corporate Crocodile - who is sending his cold-blooded minions to consume the natural resources of the planets. The core of this video-game was developed during GGJ’17, a 48h global jam, where participants are expected to produce a video-game in that short span of time. PUSH participated with a team, and the result was Hipponaut, a video-game that we are proudly developing into a product. Hipponaut was done with the Unity game engine, and represents a collaborative effort of artists and engineers.

## Tech
